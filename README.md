## ‚ú® Usage
You can either host your own instance of this startpage or use [this](https://onigiri.vercel.app/).

### Deploy you own instance
It's pretty easy, I'll suggest using vercel if you don't want to waste much time, create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you don't already have one and then just click here on this button.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fasheeeshh%2Fonigiri)

### Set as your startpage
Jsut set your browser's home url to https://onigiri.vercel.app/ if you're using my instance or your own link that you get from vercel after deploying.

## üçô Customize
To customize the startpage according to you follow these steps:

Fork the repo and clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asheeeshh/onigiri.git
```
Open the app using your code editor [I'm using vs code here].
```bash
cd onigiri
code .
npm run dev
```

### Customizing links
Go to [`/src/applist.json`](/src/applist.json).

Suppose you want to add `FaceBook` to the list, just add the following snippet to the json. The  Link's position depends on the position of the object in the array.
```json
[
  ...
  {
        "name": "facebook",
        "link": "https://facebook.com",
        "icon": "facebook"
    },
  ...
]
```

All the ions are taken from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/s). You an check the icon name for your added app [here](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/slugs.md).

### Customizing images
There are two images used in the startpage.

- Vertical Image: https://github.com/asheeeshh/onigiri/blob/665fb34867a0bae436ebb9ba08767bbf0ecbeafa/src/components/Home.vue#L23
- Banner Image: https://github.com/asheeeshh/onigiri/blob/665fb34867a0bae436ebb9ba08767bbf0ecbeafa/src/components/Home.vue#L31

You can change the images by changing the `src` in the `<img />` tag.

### Customizing colors
You can customize the colors too if you have some basic knowledge of tailwind css.
